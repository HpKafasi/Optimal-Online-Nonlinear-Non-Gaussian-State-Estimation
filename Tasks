You can consider the any discrete time system to be given but we considered the system on png file.   

Task 1: Assuming 𝑥𝑥0∼𝑁𝑁(0,1), use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the pdfs 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥1), 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥50) and 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥100). 
Explain why it would be problematic to use the traditional Kalman filter to estimate the unknown state given
the measurement data 𝑧𝑧𝑘𝑘.

Task 2: Suppose that during one experiment, the output measurements 𝑧𝑧𝑘𝑘,0≤𝑘𝑘≤100 have been recorded. Use the extended Kalman filter,
grid based method and particle filter to estimate the unknown state information 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘,0≤𝑘𝑘≤100.

Task 3: Now suppose that the actual unknown state information 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘,0≤𝑘𝑘≤100 is available. Define suitable measures to compare and evaluate
the performance of the different filtering techniques in Task 2. Explain why there are differences in their performance.

Task 4: Explore how the performance of the three filtering techniques in Task 2 can be improved. Re-estimate the unknown state information
using these improved schemes. Compare the estimation results with those obtained in Task 2 & 3.
Do they support your theoretical prediction?

Task 5: Critically evaluate your work. Have you achieved the objectives? What problems did you find during this work? What conclusions
can you draw from your design? From the experience of this work, what do you need to consider when solving a practical problem?
